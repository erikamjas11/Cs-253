CS 253  Homework # 3

Problem 1.

Write a program that performs the following two tasks:

1.	Reads an arithmetic expression in an infix form, stores it in a queue (infix queue) and converts it to a postfix form (saved in a postfix queue).  
2.	Evaluates the postfix expression.

Use the algorithms described in class/ lecture notes. Use linked lists to implement the Queue and Stack ADTs. Using Java built-in classes will result in 0 points. You must use your own Stack and Queue classes (my code is a good starting point). Submit the code + example runs to validate your code. Submit UML chart to show the program design. 

Problem 2.

Given the following postorder and inorder traversals of a binary tree, draw the tree:
   
   Postorder:  A   B   C   D   E   F   I   K   J   G   H

   Inorder:    C   B   A   E   D   F   H   I   G   K   J

Explain your answer in a systematic and recursive fashion.
